An example is a database with weak or no passwords that is only accessible internally. This database could easily be compromised by an actor that had access to the internal network.

An example is a service account with access to more projects than it should have. If an actor gains access to the service account, they could potentially use that access to manipulate a project the service account was not intended to. Threat: Indicates a threat that is able to cause operational impact but may not access data or execute unauthorized code.",
