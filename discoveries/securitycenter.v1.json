Use a partial match on the empty string to filter based on a property existing: `source_properties.my_property : \"\"` Use a negated partial match on the empty string to filter based on a property not existing: `-source_properties.my_property : \"\"`",

The fields map to those defined in the Asset resource. Examples include: * name * security_center_properties.resource_name * resource_properties.a_property * security_marks.marks.marka The supported operators are: * `=` for all value types. * `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003e=`, `\u003c=` for integer values. * `:`, meaning substring matching, for strings. The supported value types are: * string literals in quotes. * integer literals without quotes. * boolean literals `true` and `false` without quotes. The following are the allowed field and operator combinations: * name: `=` * update_time: `=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003e=`, `\u003c=` Usage: This should be milliseconds since epoch or an RFC3339 string.
