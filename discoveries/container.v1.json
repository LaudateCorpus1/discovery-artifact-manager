By default, the cluster is created in the project's [default network](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/networks-and-firewalls#networks). One firewall is added for the cluster. After cluster creation, the Kubelet creates routes for each node to allow the containers on that node to communicate with all other instances in the cluster. Finally, an entry is added to the project's global metadata indicating which CIDR range the cluster is using.",

(maxUnavailable + maxSurge) determines the level of parallelism (how many nodes are being upgraded at the same time). Note: upgrades inevitably introduce some disruption since workloads need to be moved from old nodes to new, upgraded ones. Even if maxUnavailable=0, this holds true. (Disruption stays within the limits of PodDisruptionBudget, if it is configured.) Consider a hypothetical node pool with 5 nodes having maxSurge=2, maxUnavailable=1. This means the upgrade process upgrades 3 nodes simultaneously. It creates 2 additional (upgraded) nodes, then it brings down 3 old (not yet upgraded) nodes at the same time.
