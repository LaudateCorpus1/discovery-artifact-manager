The parts, if concatenated, must represent the same input as would be read by the current task if the split did not happen. The exact way in which the original task is decomposed into the two parts is specified either as a position demarcating them (stop_position), or explicitly as two DerivedSources, if this task consumes a user-defined source type (dynamic_source_split). The \"current\" task is adjusted as a result of the split: after a task with range [A, B) sends a stop_position update at C, its range is considered to be [A, C), e.g.: * Progress should be interpreted relative to the new range, e.g. \"75% completed\" means \"75% of [A, C) completed\" * The worker should interpret proposed_stop_position relative to the new range, e.g. \"split at 68%\" should be interpreted as \"split at 68% of [A, C)\". * If the worker chooses to split again using stop_position, only stop_positions in [A, C) will be accepted. * Etc. dynamic_source_split has similar semantics: e.g., if a task with source S splits using dynamic_source_split into {P, R} (where P and R must be together equivalent to S), then subsequent progress and proposed_stop_position should be interpreted relative to P, and in a potential subsequent dynamic_source_split into {P', R'}, P' and R' must be together equivalent to P, etc.",

This does not necessarily equal number of records. An input that can be read in parallel down to the individual records is called \"perfectly splittable\". An example of non-perfectly parallelizable input is a block-compressed file format where a block of records has to be read as a whole, but different blocks can be read in parallel. Examples: * If we are processing record #30 (starting at 1) out of 50 in a perfectly splittable 50-record input, this value should be 21 (20 remaining + 1 current). * If we are reading through block 3 in a block-compressed file consisting of 5 blocks, this value should be 3 (since blocks 4 and 5 can be processed in parallel by new tasks via dynamic splitting and the current task remains processing block 3). * If we are reading through the last block in a block-compressed file, or reading or processing the last record in a perfectly splittable input, this value should be 1, because apart from the current task, no additional remainder can be split off."
