A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both.

This is the time between (read_time - compare_duration) and read_time. The state value is derived based on the presence of the asset at the two points in time. Intermediate state changes between the two times don't affect the result. For example, the results aren't affected if the asset is removed and re-created again. Possible \"state\" values when compare_duration is specified: * \"ADDED\": indicates that the asset was not present before compare_duration, but present at reference_time. * \"REMOVED\": indicates that the asset was present at the start of compare_duration, but not present at reference_time. * \"ACTIVE\": indicates that the asset was present at both the start and the end of the time period defined by compare_duration and reference_time. This field is ignored if `state` is not a field in `group_by`."
