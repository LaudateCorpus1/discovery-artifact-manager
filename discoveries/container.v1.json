(maxUnavailable + maxSurge) determines the level of parallelism (how many nodes are being upgraded at the same time). Note: upgrades inevitably introduce some disruption since workloads need to be moved from old nodes to new, upgraded ones. Even if maxUnavailable=0, this holds true. (Disruption stays within the limits of PodDisruptionBudget, if it is configured.) Consider a hypothetical node pool with 5 nodes having maxSurge=2, maxUnavailable=1. This means the upgrade process upgrades 3 nodes simultaneously. It creates 2 additional (upgraded) nodes, then it brings down 3 old (not yet upgraded) nodes at the same time. This ensures that there are always at least 4 nodes available."
