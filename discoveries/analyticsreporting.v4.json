Each bucket is closed on the lower end, and open on the upper end. The \"first\" bucket includes all values less than the first boundary, the \"last\" bucket includes all values up to infinity. Dimension values that fall in a bucket get transformed to a new dimension value. For example, if one gives a list of \"0, 1, 3, 4, 7\", then we return the following buckets: - bucket #1: values \u003c 0, dimension value \"\u003c0\" - bucket #2: values in [0,1), dimension value \"0\" - bucket #3: values in [1,3), dimension value \"1-2\" - bucket #4: values in [3,4), dimension value \"3\" - bucket #5: values in [4,7), dimension value \"4-6\" - bucket #6: values \u003e= 7, dimension value \"7+\" NOTE: If you are applying histogram mutation on any dimension, and using that dimension in sort, you will want to use the sort type `HISTOGRAM_BUCKET` for that purpose. Without that the dimension values will be sorted according to dictionary (lexicographic) order. For example the ascending dictionary order is: \"\u003c50\", \"1001+\", \"121-1000\", \"50-120\" And the ascending `HISTOGRAM_BUCKET` order is: \"\u003c50\", \"50-120\", \"121-1000\", \"1001+\" The client has to explicitly request `\"orderType\": \"HISTOGRAM_BUCKET\"` for a histogram-mutated dimension.",
