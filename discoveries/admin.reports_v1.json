In the following Admin Activity example, the \u003c\u003e operator is URL-encoded in the request's query string (%3C%3E): GET...&eventName=CHANGE_CALENDAR_SETTING &filters=NEW_VALUE%3C%3EREAD_ONLY_ACCESS In the following Drive example, the list can be a view or edit event's `doc_id` parameter with a value that is manipulated by an 'equal to' (==) or 'not equal to' (\u003c\u003e) relational operator. In the first example, the report returns each edited document's `doc_id`. In the second example, the report returns each viewed document's `doc_id` that equals the value 12345 and does not return any viewed document's which have a `doc_id` value of 98765. The \u003c\u003e operator is URL-encoded in the request's query string (%3C%3E): GET...&eventName=edit&filters=doc_id GET...&eventName=view&filters=doc_id==12345,doc_id%3C%3E98765 The relational operators include: - `==` - 'equal to'. - `\u003c\u003e` - 'not equal to'. It is URL-encoded (%3C%3E). - `\u003c` - 'less than'. It is URL-encoded (%3C). - `\u003c=` - 'less than or equal to'. It is URL-encoded (%3C=). - `\u003e` - 'greater than'. It is URL-encoded (%3E). - `\u003e=` - 'greater than or equal to'. It is URL-encoded (%3E=). *Note:* The API doesn't accept multiple values of a parameter. If a particular parameter is supplied more than once in the API request, the API only accepts the last value of that request parameter. In addition, if an invalid request parameter is supplied in the API request, the API ignores that request parameter and returns the response corresponding to the remaining valid request parameters. If no parameters are requested, all parameters are returned. "
